# Local Development Setup

Your app is now ready to run locally without any Replit dependencies!

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit `.env` with your MongoDB connection string (already included).

3. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will run on `http://localhost:5000`

## What was changed:

✅ **Removed Replit Auth** - Replaced with simple session-based authentication  
✅ **Removed PostgreSQL dependencies** - Uses only your MongoDB Atlas database  
✅ **Created local auth system** - Simple session management  
✅ **Environment setup** - Uses standard .env file  
✅ **Removed Replit packages** - openid-client, passport, memoizee removed  

## Files you can delete (Replit-specific):
- `drizzle.config.ts` (PostgreSQL config, not needed)  
- Any remaining `.replit` or `replit.nix` files  

Your app now works completely independently of Replit!
