# Version-Matched React Native Setup

## The Problem
React Native 0.80.2 expects React 19.1.0, but most packages still use React 18. This creates dependency conflicts.

## Solution: Use Compatible Versions

### Option 1: React Native 0.73 + React 18 (Recommended)
```powershell
# Cancel current installation (Ctrl+C)

# Create project with compatible versions
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init PosthumousNotificationApp --template react-native-template-typescript@0.73.2

cd PosthumousNotificationApp

# These versions work perfectly together:
npm install @react-navigation/native@^6.1.7 @react-navigation/stack@^6.3.17 @react-navigation/bottom-tabs@^6.5.8 react-native-screens@^3.22.1 react-native-safe-area-context@^4.7.1 react-native-gesture-handler@^2.12.1 react-native-reanimated@^3.3.0 @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^1.19.1 react-native-vector-icons@^10.0.0 react-hook-form@^7.45.2
```

### Option 2: Force React 19 + React Native 0.80 (Advanced)
```powershell
# After creating RN 0.80 project
cd PosthumousNotificationApp

# Force install React 19
npm install react@19.1.0 @types/react@^18.2.6

# Install navigation with forced compatibility
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs --force

# Install other dependencies
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-vector-icons react-hook-form --force
```

### Option 3: Expo with Automatic Version Management (Easiest)
```powershell
# Cancel current installation (Ctrl+C if stuck)

# Clear any partial installations
rm -rf PosthumousNotificationApp
# Or on Windows: rmdir /s PosthumousNotificationApp

# Use Expo CLI directly (bypasses create-expo-app)
npm install -g expo-cli@6.3.10

# Create project with specific Expo version
expo init PosthumousNotificationApp --template expo-template-blank-typescript

cd PosthumousNotificationApp

# Upgrade to latest Expo SDK
npx expo install --fix

# Install navigation (Expo manages versions automatically)
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated

# Install other dependencies
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-hook-form
npx expo install expo-vector-icons
```

## Version Compatibility Matrix

### ✅ Working Combinations:

**React Native 0.73.2:**
- React: 18.2.0
- @react-navigation/native: ^6.1.7
- TypeScript: ^5.0.4

**React Native 0.72.6:**
- React: 18.2.0
- @react-navigation/native: ^6.1.6
- TypeScript: ^5.0.4

**Expo SDK 49:**
- React: 18.2.0
- React Native: 0.72.6
- @react-navigation/native: ^6.1.7

### ❌ Problematic Combinations:
- React Native 0.80+ with React 18
- React Native 0.73+ with React 17
- Old navigation versions with new React Native

## Quick Check After Installation

```powershell
# Verify versions match
npm list react react-native

# Should show compatible versions like:
# react@18.2.0
# react-native@0.73.2
```

## My Recommendation: Option 1 (RN 0.73)

Use React Native 0.73.2 because:
- Stable and well-tested
- Perfect React 18 compatibility
- All navigation packages work without conflicts
- Easier APK generation
- Better community support

## Updated Package.json for RN 0.73

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-native": "0.73.2",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^6.1.7",
    "@react-navigation/stack": "^6.3.17",
    "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.5.8",
    "react-native-screens": "^3.22.1",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^4.7.1",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.12.1",
    "react-native-reanimated": "^3.3.0",
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.19.1",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.0.0",
    "react-hook-form": "^7.45.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.2.6",
    "@types/react-native": "^0.73.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.4"
  }
}
```

Your posthumous notification system will work perfectly with these matched versions, and you'll be able to generate APK files without any dependency conflicts.
