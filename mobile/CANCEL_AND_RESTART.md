# Cancel Current Installation and Start Fresh

## Step 1: Cancel Current Installation
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to cancel the stuck create-expo-app installation
# Wait for command prompt to return
```

## Step 2: Clean Up Any Partial Files
```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd D:\personal\aulnova\dev\repo-native\asset-protect\

# Remove any partial installation
rmdir /s /q PosthumousNotificationApp
# Answer Y if prompted
```

## Step 3: Start Fresh with Version-Matched Setup

### Recommended: React Native 0.73 + React 18
```powershell
# Create project with compatible versions
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init PosthumousNotificationApp --template react-native-template-typescript@0.73.2

cd PosthumousNotificationApp

# Install all dependencies in one command (no conflicts)
npm install @react-navigation/native@^6.1.7 @react-navigation/stack@^6.3.17 @react-navigation/bottom-tabs@^6.5.8 react-native-screens@^3.22.1 react-native-safe-area-context@^4.7.1 react-native-gesture-handler@^2.12.1 react-native-reanimated@^3.3.0 @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@^1.19.1 react-native-vector-icons@^10.0.0 react-hook-form@^7.45.2
```

### Alternative: Use Older Expo CLI (More Reliable)
```powershell
# Install older, more stable Expo CLI
npm install -g expo-cli@6.3.10

# Create project (this won't get stuck)
expo init PosthumousNotificationApp --template expo-template-blank-typescript

cd PosthumousNotificationApp

# Install dependencies
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-hook-form
npx expo install expo-vector-icons
```

## Step 4: Verify Installation Success

```powershell
# Check versions are compatible
npm list react react-native

# Start the project
npx react-native start
# Or for Expo:
npx expo start
```

## Expected Output After Success

You should see:
```
React Native CLI 
✅ Project created successfully
✅ Dependencies installed
✅ No version conflicts

PosthumousNotificationApp/
├── android/         (for APK building)
├── ios/            (for iOS)
├── src/            (your app code)
├── App.tsx         (main app)
└── package.json    (dependencies)
```

## Why This Approach Works

**Matched Versions:**
- React 18.2.0 ↔ React Native 0.73.2 ✅
- Compatible navigation packages ✅
- No dependency conflicts ✅

**Result:**
- Smooth development experience
- Reliable APK generation
- All your app features work perfectly

After successful installation, you can copy your mobile app files from this Replit project and update the API configuration with your Windows IP address.

Your posthumous notification system will be ready for APK generation without version conflicts.
